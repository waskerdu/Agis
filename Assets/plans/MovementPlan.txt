-Ideal Outcome
    We want player movement to feel snappy, responsive
    Need to be able to effect player movement with bounce pads, etc



-Ideas
    Player has public velocity vector2, is set every frame by movement method
    Turn off movement method during status effect caused by bounce pad, set vel 
        Status effect wears off
        Bounce pad would need to be quick and wear off once player reaches top of arc or stops moving up, taking control from them could piss them off / kill gameplay flow 

    Returning early can save us a lot of operations per frame

    Try to only set vel once per frame

    Use unity’s physics more fully? 
        Are we breaking unity’s physics by moving dynamic objects directly? Wasting operations calculating physics that isn't being used?
